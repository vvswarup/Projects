For this project, I was given a dataset showing cell-phone plan cancellations with a number of different input variables. My
task was to select a set of models to use, train the models, and select the best model from the set that would best predict
the data. After submitting my final model to the instructor, the instructor checked the predictive performance of the model using 
a test dataset. The performance of each student's model was then ranked by its performance. My model (Gradient Boost Method) was 
the winner out of twelve submissions.
